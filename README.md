# Secure-Notes-App

The Secure Notes App is a Python-based application that provides a secure environment for managing personal notes. Built with Tkinter for the graphical interface and AES encryption for data protection, the app ensures that all notes are stored in an encrypted format. Users can easily save and retrieve notes, with full confidence that their data is safe from unauthorized access.

The application offers a password protection system. On first use, users are prompted to set a password, which is securely stored using SHA-256 hashing. Each subsequent use requires authentication, ensuring only authorized users can access the encrypted notes.

The interface is clean and user-friendly, featuring a pastel-themed design. Users can quickly type notes in a text area and save or load them with the click of a button. This app is ideal for anyone seeking a lightweight, secure solution for managing sensitive information.
